# ClassmateMemory

basic usage instrucitons:
1.  In a terminal, change directory to "Scripts"
2.  run the following command:
    "python ClassmateBatch.py ../ReportingWork"
3. View output files in your ReportingWork directory

To run these scripts on example data, use the included files in the ReportingWork directory.
If you would like to skip the tedious name matching step at the 0_Raw stage, rename the "Input" directory to "InputComplete". Generated index files have already been included in the 1_Index/Output folder, which will allow the analysis scripts to run.
